Disclaimer:  This Framework is designed by Nishant Verma. Read more about me on http://www.nishantverma.com
The primary purpose of this framework is to get you started and see how to lay out a frame work structure.

You can reach me or mail me : nishuverma@gmail.com for any queries regarding this framework and it's implementation.

Typical framework Stack looks like: Eclipse + TestNG + WebDriver + Sikuli

WebDriver : WebDriver is a clean, fast framework for automated testing of webapps. 

Sikuli: Is a open source MIT project which is based on image recognition. 
You can read more about it here: http://sikuli.org/

This framework exploits both the capability of Selenium as well as sikuli-script.jar which you can 
be obtained by installing the Sikuli first and then copying the .jar from the installed folder path.
Mail me if you face any issues.

You can use Sikuli for all UI level validation.

Thanks,
Nishant Verma
